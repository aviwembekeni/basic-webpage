            <b>Los Angeles</b> <br/> <span>Los Angeles is home to some of the USA’s best beaches and each one has its own unique character. Venice Beach is one of LA’s most known beaches and with its numerous galleries, quirky shops, street performers, Muscle Beach body-builders and more, it's the perfect place for a spot of people watching!
                Santa Monica is another fantastic LA beach district and its perfect for those who want to chill out in the sun, get active on the beach or maybe do a spot of shopping. Outside of these two beaches though, you can find a whole host of others to visit including Manhattan Beach and Malibu.
